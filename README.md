# ml_cars
When I was undergraduate third grader, this scripts was implemented with Python and Keras. They will classify kind of cars by supervised learning. In creating datasets, images in them was collected with Python crawler I was implemented (BautifulSoup4). That object is Microsoft Bing images search. In machine learning, a learning weight was obtained from prior learning on the original learning model. After that, finetuning-dataset was classified by using the weight parameter.

These datasets are configured of Audi, Benz, BMW, Lexus and Peugeot.  In prior learning, this model learns 4 labels (Audi, Benz, BMW and Lexus). In finetuning, it does 5 labels adding Peugeot.
